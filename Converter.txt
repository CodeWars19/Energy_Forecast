To convert the neural network you have saved from an h5 file to a json file, please input the following code into your local terminal

tensorflowjs_converter \
     --input_format=keras \
     model_py/model.h5 \
     model_js
     
If you have saved the neural network as anything else other than model_py/model.h5, please rename the filepath in the code to the filepath you've chosen.
